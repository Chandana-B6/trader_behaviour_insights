Trader Behavior Insights using Bitcoin Market Sentiment
Project Overview

This project analyzes how cryptocurrency trader performance and behavior change under different Bitcoin market sentiment conditions such as Fear, Greed, Extreme Fear, and Extreme Greed.

The objective is to understand whether trader profitability and trading behavior vary depending on overall market psychology and to derive practical trading insights from historical trading activity.

#### Datasets Used
1. Bitcoin Market Sentiment Dataset

Contains daily market sentiment classification based on the Fear & Greed Index.

2. Historical Trader Data (Hyperliquid)

Trade-level dataset containing execution details of traders.

### Workflow
1. Data Preparation

2. Feature Engineering

3. Analysis

##### Key Findings

Trader profitability varies significantly across market sentiment conditions.

High trading activity performs better during Fear markets where volatility is higher.

During Extreme Greed periods, lower trading activity tends to produce better outcomes, suggesting overtrading risk.

Market sentiment influences trader behavior and performance patterns.

###### Strategy Insights

Increase trading participation during Fear markets to capture volatility-driven opportunities.

Reduce excessive trading during Extreme Greed phases to avoid crowded market conditions.

Trading behavior should adapt dynamically to market sentiment rather than remain fixed.


#### Conclusion

This project demonstrates how combining market sentiment with trader behavior data can provide meaningful insights into profitability patterns. Sentiment-aware trading behavior can potentially improve decision-making and risk management.
